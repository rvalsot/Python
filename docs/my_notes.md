From the Udemy Course with the same name by: Tim Buchalka, available [here](https://www.udemy.com/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/learn/v4/overview)

## Installation in Ubuntu:

Mostly, Linux distributions come with Python 3.5+ and Python 2.7+, to check it:
``` shell
$ python3 -V
$ 3.5.2
```
The current version is about `3.5.2+`.

## The Basics

Python is an Object-Oriented-Interpreted Language, can run in almost all OS.

Typing:
* It is strictly typed.
* It is dynamically typed.

__Comments__

Comments are done the next way:

``` python
# This is a comment:
```

__Input / Output__

To log on the console, use `print(what)` and `input("Message: ")` to receive data:
``` python
variable = input("Enter your age: ")
print(variable)
```

Escape characters include: tab (`\t`), new line (`\n`).

To ease multi line printing, use triple quotes:

``` python
aSplitedString = """ This is a multi line, but single string,
it continues here!"""
```
